These _two_ **pairs of characters** are used for creating a string.

# `' '` or `" "`

You can use either character, it does not matter.

## `' '`

- _singular_: single quote
- _plural_: single quotes

## `" "`

- _singular_: double quote
- _plural_: double quotes

```js
'use strict';

let simpleString = 'abc';

let dogNoise = 'the dog says "woof"';
let catNoise = "the cat says 'meow'";
```

> PS. _back-ticks_ (<code>\` \`</code>) can also be used to create a _template
> literal_, you'll learn about this in Debugging.

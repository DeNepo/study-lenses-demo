How do you write a block comment (multiple lines) for developers to read that
the computer will ignore when running your code?

# `/* a block comment */`

- Open the comment: `/* ...` slash, asterisk
- Close the comment: `... */` asterisk, slash

```js
'use strict';

/*
  this program does nothing

  all the lines are comments!
*/
```

</details>

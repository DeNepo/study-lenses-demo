# DOM I/O

These exercises do not use `prompt`/`alert`/`confirm`, instead they use the DOM
I/O library. There are examples in this folder that can help you figure it out,
and you can also check [the documentation](../../../lib/dom-io/DOCS.md) for more
information.

Open up VSCode and practice your full dev workflow:

- pick an exercise to work on
- open the HTML file in your browser with _LiveServer_
- edit the JS files in VSCode
- check your work in the browser by studying logs and using the debugger

You can solve these exercises using only JS language features you've studied so
far in Just Enough JavaScript.
